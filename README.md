# Climate-Website-Bootswatch
A website with Bootswatch styling showcasing the relationship between climate and latitude for 500+ randomly selected cities around the world


The purpose of this project was to analyze the relationship between weather and latitude. To explore this relationship in an unbiased manner, an automated script that randomly selects 500+ cities around the world and pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API was created.

After assembling the dataset, various aspects of the weather vs. latitude were plotted in Matplotlib. Factors analyzed included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
